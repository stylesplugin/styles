== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is this plugin free? =

Styles provides an interface for quickly adding options to the WordPress Customizer.
This framework is free. Small add-on plugins connect it to themes.
[Paid Support Services](http://stylesplugin.com/support) allow us to extend the plugin, adding options for themes or site features according to your requests.

= Does Styles support my theme? =

[Watch this walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxj61Fojm1RGevBh10U2qCqjwoH4Awo-P) for a developer's guide on how to add support. Adding one option takes only one line of code.

= I'd like to distribute a theme add-on I created for Styles =

If you [watched the walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxj61Fojm1RGevBh10U2qCqjwoH4Awo-P) and created an add-on for Styles, please share it with others. It's our goal to make the lives of theme developers and end-users much, much easier.

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =

No! Styles is very careful about only loading what is needed to get its job done.
Once done editing, stylesheets are cached and loaded for your sites users as quickly as possible.
In non-editing mode, Styles only outputs one cached CSS block to your site's header.
